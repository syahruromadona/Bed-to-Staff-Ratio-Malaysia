# Bed-to-Staff ratio in public hospital in Malaysia

## Executive summary

Malaysia’s healthcare system is experiencing increasing structural strain driven by sustained growth in service demand, population aging, and rising disease complexity. Using SQL and Excel, I pulled data from the official government data portal and analyse the number of beds and staff throughout 16 states from 2014 to 2022. The result indicates a declining bed-to-staff ratio, signalling that staffing levels are not keeping pace with available beds. I recommend two intervention to address this imbalance: 

1. Increase overall healthcare staffing levels
2. Second, address staff maldistribution across states and facilities
